Hyperion Gstreamer effects
==========================

Dev kit for creating audio visualizations for [hyperion](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion). W.I.P. Requires `Tkinter` and `pygst`.

- Based on https://github.com/Fabi1080/hyperion_effects_dev_kit

- Also uses this neat wrapper (slightly modified) https://github.com/Wintervenom/gst-spectrumdump

Gstreamer pipeline seems to freeze often (I just keep killing the python process when that happens).

Tested with leds using the json-connection: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_dO7YTh4o
